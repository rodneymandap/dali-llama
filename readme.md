# Leveled Detection for the Living Aquaculture Monitoring of Harmful Algal-Blooms (LLAMA)

## Summary

Government units grapple with the early detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs) leading to massive fish kills and lack of access to clean water for communities highly dependent on rivers and lakes for drinking or livelihood.

While there are tools and satellite data available, currently there’s a lack of open-source data due to the insufficient attention it gets compared to other natural phenomenons such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.

Hence, we are developing a real-time web app readily available for the public to encourage a proactive approach among researchers, citizen scientists, and concerned individuals towards sustained clean water & sanitation and life below water (SDGs 6 & 14).

## How We Addressed This Challenge

Llama is an open-source web app that uses satellite data to detect and analyze harmful algal blooms (HABs) as well as the predicted movements of suspected algal blooms with computer vision and machine learning. 

According to the Census of Fisheries, the vast majority of municipal fishing operations in the Philippines (1.752 million or 98.4%) were individual operations. The coastal areas that are able to identify and prevent its adverse implications give a better likelihood for the community to thrive and flourish.

## How It Works

We use near-real-time (NRT) data of water surface temperature, chlorophyll-a (Chl a) levels, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and other essential data for detecting HABs, from MODIS-Aqua, and Suomi-NPP-VIIRS.

By viewing the satellite map, local and health authorities can be informed and alerted that certain bodies of water are already polluted by algae. To maintain a healthy aquatic ecosystem,  ensuring the cleanliness of the water is essential.

## Impact

Without early detection, or more so, treatment, the algae will grow which can lead to the disruption of an ecosystem. Fish and other aquatic resources will die underneath the ocean. This occurrence has severe consequences to humans such as loss of livelihood, lack of food to eat, and lack of a clean source of water.

Societies extract vast quantities of water from rivers, lakes, wetlands, and oceans to supply the requirements of cities, farms, and industries. The information gathered by our monitoring program will let the users stay updated about the present condition of the bodies of water. 

The goals of this project are:
  - Prevention of fish kill
  - Avoidance of water contamination
  - Protection of wildlife 

In order to ensure:
  - Sustainable living
  - Livelihood of future generations 

## How We Developed This Project

Since the Philippines is surrounded by bodies of water, our team aims to create a satellite map to detect different areas prone to algae blooms. One might think that growth of the algae blooms has little environmental impact to focus our attention to. But it is not, if we ought not to take action, it can disrupt our ecosystem. 

According to Aqua Culture Alliance Org, a densely concentrated algal bloom can deplete oxygen in the water due to the high respiration rate of the algae, or by bacterial respiration during their decay. In effect, the fishes suffocate.

In addition, algae threaten humans who ingest filter-feeding shellfish like oysters and mussels. Biotoxins concentrate within the shellfish flesh, causing illnesses like paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). Crabs that feed on shellfish can also become toxic.
